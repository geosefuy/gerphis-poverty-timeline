                  <Text>1933</Text>
                  <Text>The Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933 was established during the Commonwealth period under
                    the presidency of Manuel L Quezon. It was to regulate the share-tenancy contracts by establishing
                    minimum standards providing for a 50-50 sharing contract where the “tenant's share was exempted from repayment claims of debt to landlords.”
                    But this took effect only in 1946 when the landlord-dominated municipal councils agreed to its implementation (IBON, 1988, as cited in, Macaranas, 2015).</Text>
                  <Divider></Divider>
                  <Text>Section 2 of Act no. 4054 defined Share tenancy Contracts as,
                    "A contract of share of tenancy is one whereby a partnership between a landlord and a tenant is entered into,
                    for a joint pursuit of rice agricultural work with common interest in which both parties divide between
                    them the resulting profits as well as the losses". </Text>

                  <Text>The policy was first upheld by the 8th president of the Philippines, Carlos P. Garcia, in an attempt to favor Filipino business relationships over foreign opportunities. They would simply have a priority in dealing with possible agreements, allowing Filipino businessmen to have a control in the country’s industries in its foundation.|
                    Unfortunately, although this policy looked promising for Filipino businessmen, this served to be ineffective for the working class. The rich were the sole beneficiaries for the system, and the income distribution for the middle and working class were unchanged and at times even reduced. In short, this policy was implemented simply for the Filipino elite class and no one else.</Text>

                  <Text>1963</Text>
                  <Text>Former 9th president Diosdado Macapagal failed to conduct land reform to alleviate the farmers’ constant conflict against land ownership and payment towards previously established private lands. Although a 75-hectare retention limit was implemented to help in limiting the ownership between current owners, the current status and financial capabilities of the farmers themselves are considered inadequate to the point that they are unable to buy land from them anymore. The damage caused by the previous bodies of government has made them incapable of buying land with the exception of gaining debts from the landlords themselves.</Text>

                  <Text>Because Ferdinand Marcos had led the Philippines as the former 10 president of the Philippines, he wanted to continue his reign further for a second term, although this was still unprecedented ever since Philippine independence. Because of this, Marcos led up to $50 million worth of infrastructure projects to show that there was ongoing progress and another term was needed to complete these projects and further escalate Philippines into an international scale.
                    However, the decision was proven wrong when the government was required to seek a debt rescheduling plan with the International Monetary Fund, and switch from an import-oriented to an export-oriented industrialization, causing the Philippine peso to be devalued against other currencies. This caused our goods to be priced less, which all trickled down from the major businesses to the farmers that work hard to gather these goods.</Text>

                  <Text>The Asian Financial Crisis affected most of East and Southeast Asia, dropping the values of most currencies significantly and weakening our assets and exchange rates against other countries. This indirectly affected the working class as exporting goods was less beneficial to them, as well as the inflation of prices due to lower exchange rates. Furthermore, with the addition of the ‘jueteng’ scandal by Joseph “Erap” Estrada, the Philippine peso continued to decline, only regaining its value after his impeachment and repair.</Text>
