                  <Text>Miguel López de Legazpi was considered one of the successful circumnavigators that was
                    able to conquer Cebu despite the opposition of the Filipinos. Although King Philip II from Spain
                    declared rule over the Philippines and Legazpi took control of the
                    government, several local government bodies tended to capitalize on
                    Filipinos, particularly on slavery, which was continued until the 18th century.</Text>

                  <Text>The Manila-Acapulco galleon trade opened up so many opportunities for Filipinos to export their goods,
                    but at the same time brought upon the concept of capitalism which can further damage the livelihood of lower class workers.
                    This came with the encomienda system in which feudal landlordism was already the default system, making the trade system less effective.</Text>
